### Explore US Bikeshare Data
"Explore US Bikeshare Data" was a project from Udacity for the "Programming for Data Science with Python" Nanodegree.

From Udacity:

_"In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics."_

### Description
This project allows users to explore bikeshare data by responding to preprogrammed questions. 

*These questions allow users to investigate the dataset, filtering by:*
*City
*Month
*Day of the Week

*The information provided includes:*

 **Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)*
    - *most common month
    - *most common day of week
    - *most common hour of day

**Popular stations and trip*
    - *most common start station
    - *most common end station
    - *most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

**Trip duration*
    - *total travel time
    - *average travel time

**User info*
    - *counts of each user type
    - *counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    - *earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
*The files used for the project were:*
*chicago.csv
*new_york_city.csv
*washington.csv
*bikeshare.py

*The city files contained the following information:*
*Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
*End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
*Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
*Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
*End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
*User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The NYC and Chicago files also contained the following information about the riders:
*Gender
*Birth Year

### Credits
*Built with:*
*Python 3.12.2
*time
*pandas
*numpy
