# Explore US Bikeshare Data
**"Explore US Bikeshare Data"** was a project from Udacity for the **["Programming for Data Science with Python"](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104)** Nanodegree Program.

#### From Udacity:

_"In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics."_

## Description
This project enables users to explore bikeshare data through predefined questions. It offers a user-friendly interface for seamless navigation and analysis of the dataset.

### These questions allow users to investigate the dataset, filtering by:
* City
* Month
* Day of the Week

### The information provided includes:

 * #### Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
    * most common month
    * most common day of week
    * most common hour of day

 * #### Popular stations and trip
    * most common start station
    * most common end station
    * most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

 * #### Trip duration
    * total travel time
    * average travel time

 * #### User info
    * counts of each user type
    * counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    * earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

## Files Used
### The files used for the project were:
* chicago.csv
    * Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 in Chicago
* new_york_city.csv
    * Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 in NYC
* washington.csv
    * Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 in Washington
* bikeshare.py
    * A template with helper code and comments to help guide the project

#### The city files contained the following information:
* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

#### The NYC and Chicago files also contained the following information about the riders:
* Gender
* Birth Year

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/h-rouse/pdsnd_github.git
   ```
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the bikeshare.py file using Python:
    ```
    python bikeshare.py
    ```
5. Follow the prompts in the terminal to interactively explore the bikeshare data.
